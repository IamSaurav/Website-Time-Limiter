Website Time Limiter Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension to help you manage your time on specific websites by setting daily usage limits. Once the time limit is reached, the website is blocked until the next day or until you extend the time.
Features

Set Daily Time Limits: Add websites and set daily time limits (in hours, minutes, and seconds) via a user-friendly popup.
Real-Time Tracking: Tracks time spent on specified websites across all open tabs (background script tracks usage).
Automatic Blocking: Redirects to a "blocked" page when the time limit is reached for a website.
Time Extension: Option to extend time from the blocked page (via a message to the background script).
Daily Reset: Automatically resets time limits at the start of each day.
Professional UI: Clean and modern popup design with a card-based layout for managing websites.

Load the Extension in Chrome:

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner).
Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files (website-time-limiter).


Verify Installation:

The extension icon should appear in the Chrome toolbar.

Usage

Open the Popup:

Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup.


Add a Website:

Enter the website URL (e.g., facebook.com) in the "Website" input field.
Set the daily time limit using the "Hours," "Minutes," and "Seconds" fields.
Click the "Add" button to save the limit.
The website will appear in the list below with its daily quota and remaining time.


Monitor Time Usage:

Open any tab to a tracked website (e.g., https://facebook.com).
The extension tracks the time spent on the website across all tabs.
The "Time Left" in the popup updates as you use the website (if the popup is open).


Blocked Page:

When the time limit is reached, the website tab redirects to a "blocked" page (blocked.html).
From the blocked page, you can extend the time (if implemented) by sending a message to the background script.


Remove a Website:

In the popup, click the "Remove" button next to a website to delete its time limit.



Files Overview

content.js: Handles the popup UI logic, including adding/removing websites, displaying the list, and listening for storage changes to update the UI.
background.js: Runs in the background to track time usage across all open tabs, decrement time limits, reset limits daily, and block websites when limits are reached.
blocked.html: The page displayed when a website's time limit is reached (youâ€™ll need to create this file if not already present).
manifest.json: The extension manifest file (ensure it includes the necessary permissions and scripts).
