A Chrome extension to help you manage your time on specific websites by setting daily usage limits. Once the time limit is reached, the website is blocked until the next day or until you extend the time.

- **Automatic Blocking:** Redirects to a "blocked" page when the time limit is reached for a website.
- **Time Extension:** Option to extend time from the blocked page (via a message to the background script).
- **Daily Reset:** Automatically resets time limits at the start of each day.

## Known Issues

When the daily quota is over the block page opens, by replacing the current page. Because of that when you try to ignore time for 1 min, 15 mins the pages refrshes, which is a bad experience.
